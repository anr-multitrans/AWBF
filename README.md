## Adaptive Weighted boxes fusion

Repository based on [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/217881799.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/217881799)
containing Python implementation of several methods for ensembling boxes from object detection models: 

* Non-maximum Suppression (NMS)
* Soft-NMS [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04503)
* Non-maximum weighted (NMW) [[2]](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017_workshops/papers/w14/Zhou_CAD_Scale_Invariant_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf)
* **Weighted boxes fusion (WBF)** [[3]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13302) - new method which gives better results comparing to others 

In addition to a multi-agent system (MAS) that implement WBF in a decentralized and adaptive manner.

## Requirements

Python 3.*, Numpy, Numba

## Examples 
Pleas refer to main.py and AWBF_Examples folder (jupiter notebook for visualizing the bounding box evolution)
